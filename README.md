# matplotlib-tools

A bunch of functions I used in the past for my plots
- `create_plot` generates a matplotlib figure and axis with the the advantage of having a fixed box size
- `legend_modulus` automatically add a legend for oscillatory rheological measurements.
- `matplotlibrc` : file droped here in case I need to reproduce old style plots somewhere else

## Things to be written : 
 
 - function for legend separationg colors and shapes
